            My self <strong>Anjana Herath</strong>, a 25-year-old from a beautiful island called Sri Lanka, born on October 4<sup>th</sup>, 1998. <I> Im an introvert who enjoy telling stories with images, which is why I have a strong affinity for both cinematography and content creation.</I> I frequently spend my free time playing video games or using my artistic talents to create <abbr title="Three Diamentional">3D </abbr>artwork and paintings. Through these interests, I can express myself creatively and venture into new imaginary worlds.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            <strong>Formula 1 racing </strong> and<strong> boxing </strong>are among my favorite pastimes. The speed and precision of Formula One races, as well as the raw ferocity of boxing contests, never let up on me. Whether I'm filming moments or exploring virtual worlds, I enjoy the excitement and inventiveness that each venture brings. In everything I do, I strive to push forward the boundaries and find new ways to express myself and evolve.
