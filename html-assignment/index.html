            I'm <strong>Anjana Herath</strong>, a 25-year-old from Sri Lanka, born on October 4<sup>th</sup>, 1998. I'm deeply passionate about content creation and cinematography, <em>finding joy in bringing stories to life through visuals</em>. When I'm not behind the camera, you'll often find me immersed in the world of video games or channeling my creativity into <abbr title="Three Dimensional">3D</abbr> art and painting. These hobbies allow me to explore new realms of imagination and express myself in unique ways.

        <p style="font-size: larger;">
            Among my favorite pastimes are Formula 1 racing and boxing. The speed and precision of Formula 1 races, along with the raw intensity of boxing matches, never fail to inspire me. Whether I'm capturing moments on film or diving into virtual worlds, I thrive on the excitement and creativity that each endeavor brings. In every pursuit, I seek to push boundaries and discover new avenues for self-expression and growth.
